# Creating an Off-mesh Link

Off-Mesh Links are used to create paths crossing outside the walkable navigation [**mesh**][1] surface. For example, jumping over a ditch or a fence, or opening a door before walking through it, can be all described as Off-mesh links.

We’re going to add an Off-Mesh Link component to describe a jump from the upper platform to the ground.

1. First create **two cylinders**: **Game Object > 3D Object > cylinder**.
2. You can scale the cylinders to _(0.1, 0.5, 0.1)_ to make it easier to work with them.
3. Move the **first cylinder** at the edge of the top platform, close to the [**NavMesh**][2] surface.
4. Place the **second cylinder** on the ground, close to the NavMesh, at the location where the link should land.
5. Select the **first cylinder** cylinder and add an Off-Mesh Link component to it. Choose **Add Component** from the inspector and choose **Navigation > Off Mesh Link**.
6. Assign the **first cylinder** in the **Start** field and the **second cylinder** in the **End** field.

Now you have a functioning Off-Mesh Link set up! If the path via the off-mesh link is shorter than via walking along the Navmesh, the off-mesh link will be used.

You can use any game object in the [**Scene**][3] to hold the Off-Mesh link component, for example a fence [**prefab**][4] could contain the off-mesh link component. Similarly you can use any game object with a Transform as the start and end marker.

The NavMesh bake process can detect and create common jump-across and drop-down links automatically. Take a look at the [Building Off-Mesh Links Automatically](./BuildingOffMeshLinksAutomatically.md) for more details.
